# Aliens are here!!

## Background

The CIA has finally began to release documents that help to prove that aliens do in fact exist, and that 
there has been a major cover up for years. Your uncle doesn't sound as crazy as he once did, does he? 

Now that the truth is really "out there", we want to take a look back at the different instances in which
a poor, unfortunate soul described having seen a UFO. We have eye-witness reports that include the date/time, 
city, state, country, and shape of these UFOs. 

###Interested yet? 

Well, on this repo we have compiled a list of different eye-witness accounts and have set it up so that they
can be more easily reviewed by you. To accomplish this, we have used a simple HTML page which will show you 
everything you wanted to know about these accounts. 

Yes. There are many accounts, but with the help of javascript, we have made it easier to filter the different dates 
by using an input field that you may use to find the exact date you want.
